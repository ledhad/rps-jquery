Challenge: "Rock-Paper-Scissors"

Description:
Build a game, where two players with different strategies are playing against each other.
- Rock beats scissors
- Paper beats rock
- Scissors beats paper

Implement two players:
Player A: chooses paper every time
Player B: makes a random choice every time
 
The players will compete 100 times against each other.
As result we would like to know, who wins more often?
 
An example result would look like this:
"Player A wins 31 of 100 games"
"Player B wins 37 of 100 games"
"Tie: 32 of 100 games"
"Winner is: Player B  (37 to 31 wins)"

Criteria:
- If both players choose the same, it’s a tie
- (optional) Save games and results of a round to (mysql) database
- Build the UI as visualized on the mockup (only the dark gray and the vs. element)
- Feel free enhance the UI
- The three buttons on the bottom are for player A to choose what to set
- The other two buttons are too show the won rounds so far
- The UI will adapt to smaller/bigger window sizes
- There will be a "start game" screen at the beginning
- When the last round has been finished the results are shown and a new game can be started
- A new round can be started without a reload
- The color schema should adapt the gamigo group colors
- No frameworks have been used for coding (exception jQuery for Ajax and/or Sizzle for element selection)
- (optional) The code is well tested with a testing framework of you choice.

You can make use of free assets or create some by your own. We want to review the code and run the game by ourself.
The programming language should be html/css, javascript and php.
You can use any IDE and build tools of your choice.
